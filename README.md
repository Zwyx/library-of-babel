["The Library of Babel"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel) is a short story by Jorge Luis Borges, Argentine author and librarian, in which he explores a vast library containing all the books that it is possible to write using the latin alphabet, and that are 410 pages long.

Visitors grapple with the enormity of knowledge and the futility of finding meaning in an endless sea of randomness.

_"All â€” the detailed history of the future, the autobiographies of the archangels, the faithful catalog of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogs, the proof of the falsity of those false catalogs, a proof of the falsity of the true catalog, [...]."_

This app is a digital recreation of this concept.

It uses mathematics to retrieve the content of a book from its index in the library.
