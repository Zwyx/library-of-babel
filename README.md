Book ID = book content

Human readable ID = `Room Wall Shelf Book Page` = `[long string] [1-4] [1-5] [1-32] [1-410]`

To browse the library: create a canvas containing 1005335 pixel (about 1003x1003), each pixel able to have 81 colors. So 81^1006009 combinations. Using the mouse or the finger to draw on the canvas, each pass on a pixel increments its color code change (from 0, up to 80).

Have settings to paginate or display all book. Copy to clipboard with or without line break.

Compared to libraryofbabel.info:

- books are ordered sequentially, not randomly
- entire books can be searched, not only pages
- IDs are shorter (they are 3200 [a-z0-9] chars at lob.info)

To share pages: if the search contains less than ~1000 characters, we'll be able to add the book number to the URL. If more, we can either copy the book ID, or use the pastebin API to share it (mentioning it won't be private).
